				EVER SINCE I WAS YOUNG, I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN MANY SPORTS. RANGING FROM CASUAL BASKETBALL AND SOCCER DURING WITH MY CLASSMATES TO COMPETITIVE FENCING AND TABLE TENNIS, ONE COULD SAY I AM ATHLETIC.
				NOT ONLY DOES FENCING HELP KEEP ME HEALTHY AND ACTIVE, IT ENFORCES SPORTSMANSHIP AND RESPECT FOR EACH OF THE CONTENDERS. FURTHERMORE, TRAVELLING TO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS FOR COMPETITIONS EXPOSES ME TO 
				DIFFERENT CULTURES AND PEOPLE.

		FENCING IS ONE OF THE OLDEST SPORTS IN HISTORY AND ITS MADE UP OF FOIL, EPEE AND SABER. FENCE FOIL, WHICH IS THE MORE DEFENSIVE AND FAST-PACED WEAPON. READ UP MORE ON FENCING <a class="here" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing" target=”_blank”>HERE</a>. 
		FENCING IS ALSO KNOWN AS THE GENTLEMAN'S SPORT, AND IT HAS TAUGHT ME MANY THINGS WHICH HAVE HELPED MY GROW. I BEGAN FENCING WHEN I WAS YEARS OLD, AND STARTED FENCING COMPETITIVELY WHEN I WAS 10. NOW I FENCE FOR THE CLUB, TORONTO FENCING CLUB. 
		OVER 3 YEARS, I HAVE ATTENDED COMPETITIONS IN SINGAPORE, CANADA, AND THE UNITED-STATES. I HAVE WON 2 MAJOR COMPETITIONS WHILE PLACING SECOND AND THIRD IN NUMEROUS OTHER COMPETITIONS, SUCH AS THE ONTARIO WINTER GAMES.
